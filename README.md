Project I am most proud of, representing a culmination of skills acquired throughout my career. The longest endeavor, undertaken for a month, involved intense dedication, with work extending up to 12-14 hours a day, even during holidays and the New Year. This project has been a profound learning experience, contributing significantly more to my skill set than my entire career.</p>

<br>

<h2>❗❗Most important❗❗</h2>

<h3>In creating my portfolio, I'm mindful of the impact of page speed and Google ranking. While recognizing the importance of performance in SEO, this project primarily focuses on visual aesthetics as a showcase of my skills, serving as a personalized digital business card. It's worth noting that this website is not intended for active Google SEO, allowing for a more expressive visual approach.</h3>

  intrepid graphic designer who decided to go wild in the front-end
  field. My coding adventure began in May 2023 when I decided it was
  time to inject some creativity into my life â€“ to stop being just a
  spectator and become a creator`,

    text: `My fascination with websites goes way back, even before I started uncovering the secrets of coding. I honed my graphic design skills since elementary school. After a few years' hiatus, I returned to the world of pixels. Frankly, that wasn't enough for me. Instead of settling for just design, I set out to make projects not only look beautiful but also function seamlessly.`,
  },
  {
    text: `So, I embarked on my journey as a web designer. But then I thought, why stop at design when I can weave these pages into the web myself? Thus, the front-end initiative was born, where my sites became more than just a plain sketch.`,

  {
    text: `As I explore front-end development, I've become accustomed to spending long hours coding, sometimes from 8 AM to 10 PM. It feels as natural as breathing. I repeated animations so often that I thought I was already an animation also! ðŸ˜²ðŸ˜„`,

    text: `I constantly evolve, learning from the best, and every mistake is just another step towards perfection. I believe my passion for front-end could be a perfect addition to your team.`,
